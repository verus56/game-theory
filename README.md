# Game Theory Helper

This Python module provides functions to analyze strategic interactions in two-player games using game theory concepts. It includes functions to calculate supports, payoffs, and Nash equilibria, as well as to check for Pareto dominance.

## Features

- Compute support sets for mixed strategies.
- Calculate strategy payoffs.
- Determine player payoffs.
- Verify Nash equilibrium conditions.
- Enumerate all possible supports.
- Identify Pareto dominant points.
- Find Nash equilibria using linear programming.

## Requirements

- Numpy
- Scipy (for optimization functions)

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
